# My Coding Scratchpad

Scratchpad for gists, snippets, sharing code, small projects, etc. (see branches).
Using the [unlisted repositories trick](https://dev.to/agentender/unlisted-github-repositories-4jin).

```bash
# 1. establish a new branch in jankudev/scratchpad (Github)
# 2. clone single branch into a directory
git clone -b <branch> --single-branch git@github.com:jankudev/scratchpad.git <dir>
```

## List of scratchpad branches (aka unlisted repositories)
_This is a list of the virtual repositories using branches with some basic information to help me remember why I made them._
_As this is a 'scratchpad' it's just for archiving some coding snippets and proof-of-concepts so there are no hundreds of repositories in my profile (well I wouldn't be a problem now but I plan to do some pet-projects and opensource contributions so it would be hard to orient and the Github organizations are a pain in the ass to use for that)._
